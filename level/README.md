# Cozmo acts like a level to help you build things
Cozmo will detect a variation of angular position (pitch) and set its backpack colors accordingly. The lights behave in the same way a bubble would, plus some changing colors making it more fun. 

## Set it up
Lay Cozmo on a flat surface (the ground for instance) and then start the script. Cozmo will then raise its lift and its backpack LEDs will go on. If all three are green, then Cozmo considers it's laying flat which is good! Otherwise only two LEDs will turn on, turning more and more to red depending on the angle that is detected. 

## When you're done
When your surface is well position, tell Cozmo he helped you succeed by giving him a small "check" to let him know his job here is done!
